# Hang In There
Ages and ages ago, a friend of mine did a series of paintings of fictional 1980s arcade machines. His paintings were little more than a name and a picture of an arcade cabinet, but they were unique and odd and packed full of nostalgia. I decided to bring a few of the paintings to life by jamming out little games based on his concepts. The first one I did was Hang In There, a game that was inspired by that goofy cat poster that any '80s kid has etched into their memory. I originally built Hang In There in 48 hours at the end of February, 2014 using Unity 5. As a development exercise, I decided to resurrect Hang in There using a modern version of Unity.

## Gameplay
Hang in There is a simple micro-game featuring all of the kid-centric stuff that distracted us from school during the glory days of the 1980s. Avoid all that stuff, study hard, and hang in there!
